**Overview & Vision**

1. **Decentralized Travel Profile**

* Travelers have sole control over access to their profile data, which may include identity and preferences. They can create and then self-host or store a profile with their preferred provider (such as established travel providers, tech companies, or other intermediaries)
* Travelers themselves control the encryption of this data, adding an essential layer of security and privacy.
This single profile enables travelers to assert their identity across digital platforms and interact with travel providers, unlocking personalized services tailored specifically to their preferences.
* The data contained within this profile can be cryptographically verified, facilitating a robust trust verification process across various service providers. Thus, it assures both security and seamless interaction between travelers and their chosen travel providers.
* This travel profile is designed to be reusable, persistent, dynamic and responsive. If the traveler updates any information or preferences, all permissioned travel providers can immediately access the update. Thus, travelers are spared the inconvenience of proactively and repeatedly updating their information across different travel providers and journeys.
* Decentralized Identity tooling allows for the limited and specific disclosure of information, including derived proof validations such as a YES / NO to a question of age qualification.

2. **Composable, modular profile**
* Profiles are assembled from pre-existing components arranged – or “composed” –  from specific use cases.
* The adaptability of the profile allows for widespread use across all areas of travel with each specific implementation using just the components required to address the targeted use-case(s) but remaining interoperable between dissimilar systems.

3. **Open-Source collaborative development**
* Free to implement and free to use, the intended development method allows for large-scale, collaborative development using open-source tooling suggesting potential for industry-wide adoption at scale.

1. **Specification introduction**

1.1. **Purpose**

The purpose of this specification is to define a dynamic traveler profile generation system that allows travel providers to request traveler information, which is then generated on-the-fly by the traveler's digital wallet or digital agent. This approach enables standardized traveler profile requests and presentation models, ensuring consistency and interoperability across the travel industry for all aspects of consumer information, including searching, shopping, reserving, purchasing, executing, and reviewing travel experiences, as well as managing travel interruptions. Designed to cater to both individual and group travel for leisure and business purposes, this system promotes a seamless and efficient experience for travelers and travel providers alike.

1.2. **Scope**

This specification covers the process of generating traveler profiles, including profile presentation requests, user consent, profile presentation, and verification. It also describes the structure of profile requests and the standardized composition of generated profiles.

  

2. **Overall Description**

2.1. **Dynamic Traveler Profile Generation Process**

The process consists of four main steps: Traveler Profile Request, User Consent, Traveler Profile Presentation, and Verification. In the first step, the travel provider requests the traveler's profile by specifying the required information. Next, the traveler, as the holder of the information, provides consent and sets any terms of use for their profile data. The traveler's digital wallet or digital agent then generates the profile, which is presented to the travel provider in the third step. Finally, the travel provider verifies the authenticity of the presented data by resolving issuer DIDs and checking signatures.

The Traveler Profile Request is the initial step in the dynamic traveler profile generation system. It is designed to ensure that travel providers can request the necessary traveler information while maintaining high level of consumer confidentiality. By utilizing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), the system enables travelers to remain anonymous during the request process, effectively addressing any concerns about privacy and personal data protection.

The Traveler Profile Request structure consists of several components, including the traveler's DID, the issuer of the verifiable credential, the category of the requested information, and individual claims within each category. Each claim is further broken down into its value, format, standard, and language. The structure also indicates whether a specific claim is required and the purpose for requesting that claim. By following this standardized structure, travel providers can ensure consistency and interoperability across the industry when requesting traveler profile information.

![](https://identity.foundation/Hospitality-and-Travel-SIG/images/profile/image_request.png)

The profile request structure is an essential aspect of the dynamic traveler profile generation process. It is crucial for travel providers to have a clear understanding of the function and purpose of each component within the structure. By doing so, they can effectively craft profile requests tailored to their specific needs while maintaining the standardization required for seamless interoperability across the travel industry. This part of the specification serves as a guide, ensuring that all parties involved have a clear understanding of the various components and their interrelationships within the request structure.

*   DID: Decentralized Identifier for the traveler
*   Issuer: Indicates the trusted entity issuing the verifiable credential
*   Category: Groups related profile elements together (e.g., demographic info, payment info)
*   Claims: Specific information requested within each category (e.g., name, phone number)
*   Value: The actual data for the claim
*   Format: The format in which the data is presented (e.g., text, date)
*   Standard: Any applicable standards or guidelines for the data
*   Language: The language used for presenting the data
*   Required: Indicates whether the claim is required or optional
*   Purpose: The purpose for requesting the specific claim

        }
      \]
    }
  \]
}
```

2.3. **Traveler** **Profile Presentation**

After the traveler's digital wallet or digital agent generates the profile based on the travel provider's request and the traveler's consent, the profile presentation is created. This presentation includes the requested information, organized by categories and claims.

Example Profile Presentation in JSON-LD:
```json
scssCopy code{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789",
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "verifiableCredential": \[
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/vc/v1",
      "id": "https://example.com/credentials/123",
      "type": \["VerifiableCredential"\],
      "issuer": "did:example:issuer123",
      "issuanceDate": "2023-04-13T00:00:00Z",
      "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:123456789",
        "demographicInfo": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "birthdate": "1990-01-01"
        }
      }
    }
  \],
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2023-04-13T00:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:123456789#key1",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..l9d0YHjcFAH2H4dB9xlWFZQLUpixVCWzn8lXY7ZNFYUxujfQkzLwGhMfKYM0pGtE8bGvk5XOMJX14qkTzTWRlCw"
  }
}
```
In the example above, the profile presentation includes the verifiable credential containing the requested demographic information (name and birthdate) and a proof, which verifies the authenticity of the presented data.

2.6. **Profile Element Categories**

Profile element categories group related profile elements together, allowing for a structured and organized presentation of information. The following list provides an exhaustive collection of profile element categories that can be used within the dynamic traveler profile generation process:

*   **Personal Identification**: Includes elements such as name, date of birth, gender, and nationality.

3. **System Features**

3.1. **Generated Profile Structure**

The generated traveler profile will have a standardized structure composed of three block types:

*   **Identifiers (DIDs)**: Unique decentralized identifiers for the traveler.
*   **Verifiable Credentials (third-party issued)**: Claims issued and verified by a trusted third party.
*   **Self-Issued Verifiable Credentials (preferences and requirements)**: Claims issued by the traveler themselves, typically containing personal preferences.

![](https://identity.foundation/Hospitality-and-Travel-SIG/images/profile/image_structure.png)Each verifiable credential block type will contain profile elements (e.g., name, phone number, passport) grouped by profile element categories (e.g., Personal Identification, Payment Information). Standardized tagging methods will be used to provide travel context for each profile element category.

3.2. **Travel Context Tags**

Travel Context Tags are an essential component of the dynamic traveler profile generation system, serving as the key to delivering context-specific traveler information to travel providers and intermediaries. These tags facilitate a seamless user experience by enabling the traveler's digital agent or wallet to compile and present relevant data based on the unique context of each travel service request.

As the travel industry encompasses a wide range of service providers and intermediaries, including resorts, cruises, online travel companies, and travel management companies, it is crucial to tailor the presentation of traveler information to suit each distinct context. By leveraging Travel Context Tags associated with various types of travel services, the traveler's digital agent or wallet can efficiently filter and present only the most pertinent data for each specific provider or intermediary request.

This strategic use of tags as shorthands not only enhances the overall travel experience but also streamlines the traveler's interaction with different travel services. With the help of Travel Context Tags, both travelers and travel providers can effortlessly navigate the dynamic traveler profile system, ensuring that the provided data is always aligned with the context of each unique travel situation.

*   **Accommodations**: Relevant for hotels, hostels, and other lodging providers. e.g. room type preference, smoking preference, loyalty program membership
